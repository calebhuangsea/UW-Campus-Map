# Test ListChildren order in two nodes file
# Tests that a graph can be created
# two nodes can be added to the graph
# two edges can be added between 2 nodes
# ListChildren order is correct

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add two nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add two edges
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e2
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
ListChildren graph1 n1
