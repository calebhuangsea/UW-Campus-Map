# Test add two edges in the same direction between two nodes file
# Tests that a graph can be created
# two nodes can be added to the graph
# two edges can be added in the same direction between 2 nodes

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add two edges in the same direction
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
