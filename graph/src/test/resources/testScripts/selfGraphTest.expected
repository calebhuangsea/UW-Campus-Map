# Test add edge for one node
# Tests that a graph can be created
# a node can be added to the graph
# an edge can be added to 1 node

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add one node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge for one edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the node in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
graph1 contains: n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
