# Test two graphs create file
# Tests that two graph can be created
# 2 nodes can be added to the graph1
# 3 nodes can be added to the graph2
# 1 edge can be added to 2 nodes in graph1
# 2 edges can be added to 3 nodes in graph2
# none of these two graphs behave incorrectly

# Create a graph1
created graph graph1

# Add two nodes to graph1
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge to graph1
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the node in the graph1 and the outgoing edge from n1
graph1 contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)

# Create a graph2
created graph graph2

# Add three nodes to graph2
added node n1 to graph2
added node n2 to graph2
added node n3 to graph2

# Add two edges to graph2
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph2
added edge e2 from n2 to n3 in graph2

# Print the node in the graph2 and the outgoing edges from n1, n2
graph2 contains: n1 n2 n3
the children of n1 in graph2 are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in graph2 are: n3(e2)
