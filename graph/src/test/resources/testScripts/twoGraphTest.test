# Test two graphs create file
# Tests that two graph can be created
# 2 nodes can be added to the graph1
# 3 nodes can be added to the graph2
# 1 edge can be added to 2 nodes in graph1
# 2 edges can be added to 3 nodes in graph2
# none of these two graphs behave incorrectly

# Create a graph1

# Add two nodes to graph1

# Add an edge to graph1

# Print the node in the graph1 and the outgoing edge from n1
